I live in Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± and am engaged in web development. I am a perfectionist and this is my advantage and at the same time a disadvantage - I try to make everything as good and scrupulous as possible, striving for the ideal, but sometimes it takes too much time and in some cases is not key, so I try to fight it and look for the golden mean.

Besides travel and wine books, I like aviation and space very much. Planes, ships launches and scientific research awaken in me a lot of curiosity and interest. One day I dream to get a flight license for a small plane.

Is it really that not boring to read about me? :) Then I will tell you one more thing about me - a hedgehog with a logo. At school I knew a lot of jokes about hedgehogs from somewhere and had a short haircut. Since then and to this day my friends call me so.
