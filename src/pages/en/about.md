# Shalom, buddy and welcome to visit me!

## For the curious traveler

I live in Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± and do web development. I am a perfectionist, so it took me almost two years to create this wonderful site.

My dream is to get a license for a light plane, but for now I fly with a drone and take <a class="text-link" href="https://unsplash.com/@jediyozh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice photos</a> on it along the way. I train for the first half marathon and learn to surf.

I still can't brag about the list of cool apps I've built, but I'm working on it. Hopefully it goes faster than this site :)

If it's so boring to read about me, then I'll tell you about the hedgehog on the logo. At school, from somewhere I knew a lot of anecdotes about hedgehogs and had a short haircut. Since then and to this day my friends call me that.

## For the employer

I have been doing web development for a little over three years. Currently working as a front-end developer at Rapyd. I mostly write in React, but I have combat experience in the backend on node.js, I understand databases and the structure of a healthy application architecture.

In addition to a high level of knowledge of JS on the most recent versions of ES, I focus on correct semantics in HTML, a11ty and modern CSS. Yes, I am not guessing the properties to make it look something like in the design, but I just do a pixel perfect layout. My another principle is performance: image optimization, correct fonts loading, placement of the necessary attributes on the external web resources.

I am a perfectionist, quality, elegance and simplicity and speed of the code are critical to me.

This site is written on the <a class="text-link" href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty</a> static engine. I believe that React should only be where you really need it, not on every landing page.
