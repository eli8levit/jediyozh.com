# Shalom, buddy and welcome to visit me!

## For the curious traveler

I live in Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±. I am a perfectionist, so it took me almost two years to create this wonderful site.

My dream is to get a license for a light plane, but for now I fly with a drone and take <a class="text-link" href="https://unsplash.com/@jediyozh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice photos</a> on it along the way. Learn to surf.

I still can't brag about the list of cool apps I've built, but I'm working on it. Hopefully it goes faster than this site :)

## For the employer

I have been doing web development for a little over three years. Currently working as a front-end developer at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.rapyd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapyd</a>. I write in React, but I have combat experience in the backend on node.js. I understand databases and the structure of a healthy application architecture.

Besides to a high JS level on the most recent versions of ES, I focus on correct semantics in HTML, a11ty and modern CSS. Yes, I am not guessing the properties to make it look something like in the design, but I do a pixel perfect layout. My another principle is performance: image optimization, fonts loading, correct attributes on the external web resources.

I am a perfectionist, quality, elegance and simplicity and speed of the code are critical to me.

This site works on <a class="text-link" href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty</a> static engine. I believe that React should be only where it should be, not on every landing page.
